# Welcome to Career Change Motivation

### View the app [here](https://careermotivation.onrender.com).

This application was created to motivate career changers to tech to keep going through the difficult parts of learning and interviewing. 

Bearing in mind that money isn't the only motivator, the second page features career changer stories. This will eventually be optimized with a search function.

Anyone who has started their career outside of tech and transitioned into a career in tech is invited to contribute.

--Built with Node.js, Express, Boostrap and EJS.

Feel free to reach out if you have suggestions or other comments.

If you are currently considering a career in tech and don't know where to start, check out [100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/).
